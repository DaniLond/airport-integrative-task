The following project solves the problem of boarding and disembarking the plane taking into account the priorities.

In the data file, there are the passengers, those passengers will then be loaded to the hash table to make a faster search and insert.

As for the list of entrance to the plane, the first class will enter first and within those, those who are furthest from the door of the plane, in each row it will be looked at which one has special needs or of legal age and the miles occupied , but keeping in mind that the highest priority is the rows. Those who are not first class, those who are furthest from the door enter.

As for the plane's departure list, those with the highest priority are those closest to the door and then those closest to the aisle and the tiebreaker is with the arrival time.
